Assuming you have a table called "songs" with the following columns:

(1)song_id (unique identifier for each song)
(2)title (song title)
(3)artist (song artist)
(4)release_year (year the song was released)
(5)audio_features (audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, etc.)

You can start with a query like this to extract the top 100 songs from 2018 for a particular listener
 (assuming you have listener information in the database as well)

(1)Limited Time Frame: The analysis is constrained to a single year.
Musical tastes can change over time, and a listener's preference in a particular year may not fully
represent their overall musical preferences.

(2)Genre and Diversity: The top 100 songs from a single year might not capture the listener's full range of musical interests.
They may enjoy a diverse set of genres and styles that may not be reflected in a single year's charts.

(3)Individual Variability: People often have personal preferences that go beyond the general characteristics of songs.
They may have emotional connections to specific tracks or artists that aren't captured by audio features alone.
